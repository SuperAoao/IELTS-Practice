As we can see, the top map shows the current situation of the Norbiton industrial area, and the bottom one displays the planned future development blueprint. Currently, the central roundabout is surrounded by factories. The roundabout extends along two roads: one to the east, which is also lined with factories, and another to the south, connected to roads leading west and east. To the north of the roundabout, a river divides the industrial area from the farmland. In the west, there is a town.

According to the future development plan, there will be some new buildings around the roundabout, including shops and a medical center. The roundabout will extend along two new paths: one to the west-north, ending at housing, and another to the north, crossing the river to reach the farmland.

In conclusion, compared to the current state, housing will replace factories, and more functional buildings will be added.
